<h1>Test program for observing shape functions</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

This program can be used for verification of the pull "Nedelec orientation fix nr.1".

<h2> Operation </h2>

The shape-functions program allows to plot shape functions on non-standard meshes
generated by non_standard_orientation_mesh() function of deal.II.
The figure below illustrates such plots.

![][fig-shape-finctions]

The idea for verification is simple: plot shape functions for all possible
orientations of the shared face and observe that the tangential components 
of the shape functions on the shared faces are continues.

All controls of the shape-functions program are located in the last two lines of the 
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/cembooks/toolbox/blob/main/shape-functions/CMakeLists.txt):

    target_compile_options(${TARGET} PRIVATE -DDIMENSION__=2 -DFEDEGREE__=2
         -DFACEORIENTATION__=0)

The macro definition DIMENSION__ can take two values: 2 and 3.  It corresponds to the parameter dim
in deal.II.

The macro definition FEDEGREE__ must be non-negative integer. This is the degree of the Nedelec
finite element being tested, i.e., FE_NEDELEC<DIMENSION__> fe(FEDEGREE__).

The macro definition FACEORIENTATION__ in two dimensions encodes the orientation of the middle cell,
see the documentation of non_standard_orientation_mesh(). In three dimensions the macro definition
FACEORIENTATION__ can take the following values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. This numbers are
the combined orientation and are computed as

    orientation_no = face_flip*4 + face_rotation*2 + face_orientation*1;

See
[tria_orientation.h](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/blob/master/include/deal.II/grid/tria_orientation.h).
The three boolean parameters in the last equation have the following meaning:

>face_orientation - true if face is in standard orientation and false otherwise;  
>face_rotation - rotation by 90 deg counterclockwise if true;  
>face_flip - rotation by 180 deg counterclockwise if true.  

See the documentation of
[GeometryInfo<dim>](https://dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/structGeometryInfo.html)

and documentation of non_standard_orientation_mesh().
